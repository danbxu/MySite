PURPOSE: Learn web programming 

This is my first project learning about front-end programming, learning React, HTML, AND CSS. This project also allowed me to experiment with Tailwind, a CSS framework that streamlines designing the user interfaces.

For me, the challenge of this project revolved around understanding the structure of a website and utilizing useStates. Other challenges included learning CSS and finding the appropriate Tailwind syntax. I have no experience in web programming. Thanks to online resources, I was able to grasp the concepts and apply them in this project.

Note, this is a project which I learned from EdRoh and his resources can be found at https://www.youtube.com/@EdRohDev
